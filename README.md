# My Calculator App 
This portfolio project uses React / React- Redux, along with elements of HTML, CSS and Javascript to display basic calculator functions. The purpose behing this project was to quickly showcase my knowledge of state management using redux. 

# Dependencies Installed

# Run the app

# How to Use 
- This project functions as a basic calculator. Once a number is clicked on the keypad, the input will be displayed on the screen above. 
- If further calculations need to be performed without clearing a previous answer, the operation will continue on the top input box with the final answer displayed on the lower input box. 
- To clear the operation, you would click 'C'. To backspace or erase a single entry, perhaps due to a mistake, you would click 'AC'.
